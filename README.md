# MISE: Mutation-Inspired Symbolic Execution
MISE is a modified version of KLEE with support for Mutation Testing.
Find more information about the idea in the following links:
 - MISE paper: https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/sfw2.12063
 - Original KLEE Repository: https://github.com/klee/klee

MISE will apply all traditional mutation operators by default. To limit this, please use the option --mutations-file <dir-to-file> pointing to a file which contains a list of mutations operators (one per line).
